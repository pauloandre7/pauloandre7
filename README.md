<h2>Basic Presentation</h2>
<p>
    Hello, my name is <strong>Paulo André</strong>, and I currently live in Paraná, a Brazilian state. 
    <br>
    I'm in the 4th semester of <strong>Software Engineering at the Federal Technological University of Paraná</strong>
    <br>
    I come from a family with limited financial resources and had the honor of being the <strong>first in my family to 
    attend a federal university</strong>. 
    <br>
    My goal is to provide a better life for my mother, so I'm always willing to work hard to achieve a good income. 
    <br>
    Additionally, I have a strong <strong>interest in sustainable topics</strong>, to the extent that I volunteer for a 
    university project that focuses on sustainability as one of its key issues. :)
